The project will leverage pre-trained language models to generate recipes and an image generation model to visualize the final dish. The app will be deployed using Streamlit as a user facing application.\n",

        "1. Recipe Generation: Use a pre-trained Generative AI model to create unique recipes (including titles, ingredients, and steps).\n",
        "2. Image Generation: Use an AI model like DALL·E or Stable Diffusion to create a representative image of the recipe.\n",
        "4. User Interaction: Build a Streamlit app where users can input ingredients and view generated recipes and images.\n",
        "4. Scalability (Optional): Ensure the app is modular, allowing for future enhancements (e.g., dietary preferences, additional APIs).\n",
        "\n",
        "## Project Deliverables:\n",
        "1. Functional Streamlit Application:\n",
        " * A working web-based app deployed locally or on a cloud platform (e.g., Streamlit Community Cloud).\n",
        "2. Recipe Generation Backend:\n",
        " * Integration with a pre-trained model like Falcon-7B or GPT-4 for recipe generation.\n",
        "3. Image Generation Backend:\n",
        " * Integration with DALL·E or Stable Diffusion for image creation.\n",
        "4. Documentation:\n",
        " * Code documentation for easy understanding and maintenance.\n",
        " * User guide detailing how to use the application.\n",

This dish is not only thyroid-friendly but also packed with flavor and nutrients. It’s easy to prepare and has that comforting vibe you’re looking for!\n\n### Lemon Garlic Butter Shrimp with Quinoa and Seaweed Salad\n\n#### Ingredients:\n\n**For the Shrimp:**\n- 1 lb (450g) large shrimp, peeled and deveined\n- 3 tablespoons unsalted butter (or olive oil for a dairy-free option)\n- 4 cloves garlic, minced\n- Juice of 1 lemon\n- Zest of 1 lemon\n- Salt and pepper to taste\n- Fresh parsley, chopped (for garnish)\n\n**For the Quinoa:**\n- 1 cup quinoa, rinsed\n- 2 cups vegetable or chicken broth (check for gluten-free)\n- Salt to taste\n\n**For the Seaweed Salad:**\n- 1 cup dried seaweed (wakame or any preferred type)\n- 2 tablespoons rice vinegar (or apple cider vinegar)\n- 1 tablespoon sesame oil (optional)\n- 1 teaspoon honey or maple syrup (optional)\n- 1 teaspoon sesame seeds (optional)\n- 1 small cucumber, thinly sliced\n- 1 carrot, julienned\n\n#### Instructions:\n\n1. **Prepare the Quinoa:**\n   - In a medium saucepan, combine the rinsed quinoa and broth. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer for about 15 minutes or until the quinoa is fluffy and the liquid is absorbed. Fluff with a fork and season with a pinch of salt.\n\n2. **Rehydrate the Seaweed:**\n   - While the quinoa is cooking, soak the dried seaweed in warm water for about 10 minutes until it expands. Drain and squeeze out excess water. \n\n3. **Make the Seaweed Salad:**\n   - In a bowl, combine the rehydrated seaweed, cucumber, and carrot. In a small bowl, whisk together the rice vinegar, sesame oil, honey (if using), and sesame seeds. Pour over the seaweed mixture and toss to combine. Set aside.\n\n4. **Cook the Shrimp:**\n   - In a large skillet, melt the butter (or heat olive oil) over medium heat. Add the minced garlic and sauté for about 1 minute until fragrant.\n   - Add the shrimp to the skillet, season with salt and pepper, and cook for about 2-3 minutes on each side until they turn pink and opaque.\n   - Squeeze the lemon juice over the shrimp and add the lemon zest. Toss to coat.\n\n5. **Serve:**\n   - On each plate, serve a generous scoop of quinoa topped with the lemon garlic shrimp. Add a side of the seaweed salad and garnish with fresh parsley.\n\n### Preparation Tips:\n- **Shrimp Substitutes:** If you’re not a fan of shrimp, you can easily swap it for scallops or even cooked chicken.\n- **Quinoa Variations:** Feel free to use other grains like brown rice or millet if you prefer.\n- **Seaweed Options:** If you can’t find dried seaweed, you can use fresh seaweed salad from the store.\n\n### Serving Ideas:\n- Pair this dish with a light, crisp white wine like Sauvignon Blanc or a refreshing sparkling water with lemon.\n- For a heartier meal, serve with a side of roasted vegetables or a simple green salad.\n\n### Additional Notes:\nThis dish is not only comforting but also provides a great source of iodine from the seaweed and protein from the shrimp, making it perfect for thyroid health. Enjoy your cooking adventure, and savor every bite! If you have any other preferences or need more ideas, feel free to ask!"
