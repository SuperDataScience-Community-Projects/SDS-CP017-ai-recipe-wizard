## Troubleshooting

### 1. Common Issues
- **No API Token:** Ensure the `API_Token_HF_AIrecipe` environment variable is set correctly.
- **Connection Error:** Check your internet connection.
- **Longer Wait Times** Since the models are currently limited to simple open source models, 
  the running time is a bit long sometimes. But it is worth the wait to see the delicious recipes!
  If you want to use the faster models such as OpenAI models, please look at the notebook: 
  `JothiThondiraj-AIRecipeWizard-openai.ipynb`

### 2. Error Messages
- **Error generating recipe:** Verify the Hugging Face model name and token.
- **Error generating image:** Ensure the image generation model is accessible.
